### üìå Overview
A comprehensive Power BI dashboard for hospital management, providing real-time insights into patient records, doctor performance, financial metrics, and hospital operations. Built with a focus on a clean data model, powerful DAX measures, and an optimized SQL backend for performance.

### üéØ Goal of the Dashboard
The primary goal of this project is to provide a centralized, interactive, and user-friendly platform for hospital administrators and stakeholders. The dashboard aims to deliver actionable insights to:

- Enhance decision-making for hospital administrators with real-time analytics.
- Track patient admissions, discharges, and treatment history efficiently.
- Monitor doctor performance, appointments, and commission earnings.
- Optimize hospital resources (beds, medicine stock, surgeries).
- Analyze financial metrics (billing, salaries, revenue streams).

A key focus of this project is **usability and scalability**. Although the initial dataset is small, the dashboard is architected to handle a much larger volume of data, with the potential for real-time updates by simply loading more records.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Reporting & Visualization:** `Power BI Desktop`
- **Data Transformation & ETL:** `Power Query`, `SQL`
- **Data Analysis & Calculations:** `DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)`
- **Data Architecture:** `Data Modeling` (Consolidated 15 tables ‚Üí 4 optimized tables)
- **Template & Graphics:** `Figma`

### üóÑÔ∏è Data Modeling & ETL Process
The foundation of this dashboard is a robust and efficient data model. The process involved several key stages:

1.  **Initial Data Sourcing:** The project started with an extensive set of 15 raw tables, including `Appointment`, `Beds`, `Doctor`, `Patient`, `Hospital Bills`, `Medical Stock`, and `Surgery`. The `Patient` table served as the main fact table.

2.  **SQL Transformation:** Using SQL, I performed critical data cleaning and transformation tasks.
    - The `Patient` table was established as the master table by joining multiple source tables.
    - Conditional queries were used to source and retain only the required columns, optimizing the dataset.
    - A consolidated **SQL View** was created to serve as the single source of truth for Power BI.

3.  **Power BI Data Model:** By connecting Power BI directly to the SQL view, the data import process was streamlined. This strategic pre-processing in SQL drastically simplified the data model within Power BI, reducing the initial 15 tables to just **4 core tables**. This clean model is more efficient, easier to manage, and enhances dashboard performance.
